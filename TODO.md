## TODOS

### Sprites
1. [Efficiency] Refactor to use as little stack as possible. I.E. juggle registers instead of pushing them to stack
2. [QOL] Sprite Mapping when calling ShowSprite, for example, 0 maps to "smile_sprite", and we just pass 0 in some register when calling ShowSprite
3. [QOL] LUA Script for Aseprite should prompt in dialog for what we want the actual sprite variable to be called, that way when it outputs the .txt file its easy copy-pasteable into data section
4. [DOCS] Redocument sprite stuff once jobs 1. and 2. are done and working.
